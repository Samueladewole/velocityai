# Velocity Frontend Roadmap - 30 Day Launch Plan

## üéØ MISSION: Launch Velocity Core Platform in 30 Days

### **Velocity's REAL Core Value (Don't Undersell!):**
1. **ü§ñ AUTOMATED EVIDENCE COLLECTION**: 10 AI agents collect evidence from AWS/GCP/Azure/GitHub automatically
2. **‚ö° QUESTIONNAIRE INTELLIGENCE ENGINE (QIE)**: Turn questionnaires from weeks to hours
3. **üîê CRYPTOGRAPHIC TRUST SCORING**: Mathematically provable compliance scores
4. **üåê CONTINUOUS MONITORING**: Real-time compliance posture tracking
5. **üèóÔ∏è MULTI-FRAMEWORK AUTOMATION**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA in one platform

### **Current Problems to Fix:**
- [ ] Broken placeholder links throughout site
- [ ] Mixed ERIP/Velocity branding confusion
- [ ] Missing onboarding flow implementation
- [ ] Dashboard doesn't match backend capabilities
- [ ] No AI Agent monitoring interface despite having 10 agents
- [ ] No QIE interface despite having the engine
- [ ] Trust score not prominently displayed
- [ ] No evidence collection automation UI

## **DECISION POINT**

**RECOMMENDATION:** Focus 100% on Velocity core competencies for launch. ERIP tools become "what's next" after customers are successful with core compliance automation.

This approach:
- ‚úÖ Launches faster (30 days vs 90 days)
- ‚úÖ Creates focused value proposition
- ‚úÖ Proves market fit before feature bloat
- ‚úÖ Allows ERIP tools to become natural expansions
- ‚úÖ Reduces complexity and support burden

**Key Question:** Do you want to launch Velocity pure-play in 30 days, or continue with mixed ERIP integration for 90-day launch?
