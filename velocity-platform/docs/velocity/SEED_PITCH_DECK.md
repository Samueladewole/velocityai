# **VELOCITY AI**
## *The AI-Native Compliance Automation Platform*

**Transforming quarterly compliance hell into continuous, automated monitoring**

*Seed Round: €8M to capture the €8.5B compliance automation market*

**Team:** ERIP Engineering | **Date:** July 2025

---

## 💡 **SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM**

### **Compliance is Broken for Modern SaaS Companies**

#### **The Current Reality:**
- 📊 **6 months** average SOC 2 certification timeline
- 💰 **€400K+** annual compliance costs (consultants + tools + labor)
- ⏰ **800+ hours** of manual evidence collection per year
- 😤 **73%** of CTOs report compliance as biggest operational burden
- 🔄 **Quarterly panic cycles** instead of continuous monitoring

#### **Why Traditional Solutions Fail:**
- **Manual Evidence Collection**: 60%+ requires human intervention
- **Static Point-in-Time Checks**: Miss real-time configuration changes
- **Framework Silos**: Separate tools for SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.
- **Complex Implementation**: 2-6 weeks setup, requires consultants
- **No Intelligence**: Basic automation without AI/ML capabilities

> *"We spend more time proving we're secure than actually being secure"*  
> — CTO, Series C SaaS Company
