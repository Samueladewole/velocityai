# ERIP Questionnaire Intelligence Engine (QIE)

## Overview
Transform security questionnaires from time-consuming blockers into automated accelerators. Upload any questionnaire and get AI-powered assistance with evidence-backed answers.

## Core Features

### 1. Smart Upload & Processing
```typescript
interface QuestionnaireUpload {
  supported_formats: {
    documents: ["PDF", "Word", "Excel", "Google Sheets"],
    structured: ["JSON", "CSV", "XML"],
    portals: ["OneTrust", "Whistic", "Vendorpedia integration"]
  },
  
  ai_extraction: {
    question_parsing: "Extract questions with 99% accuracy",
    categorization: "Auto-categorize by framework/domain",
    duplicate_detection: "Identify similar questions across questionnaires",
    requirement_mapping: "Map to standard frameworks (SOC2, ISO, etc.)"
  }
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Answer Generation
```typescript
interface AnswerGeneration {
  answer_sources: {
    trust_equity_data: "Your verified compliance status",
    evidence_repository: "Existing documentation/evidence",
    previous_answers: "Historical questionnaire responses",
    expert_knowledge: "Validated expert contributions",
    ai_generation: "Claude-3 powered contextual answers"
  },
  
  confidence_levels: {
    verified: "100% - Direct evidence available",
    high: "90%+ - Strong supporting documentation",
    medium: "70-89% - Partial evidence, needs review",
    low: "<70% - Requires manual input",
    gap: "No data - Flags for immediate attention"
  }
}
```

### 3. The QIE Workflow

#### Step 1: Upload Questionnaire
- Drag & drop any security questionnaire
- AI extracts and structures all questions
- Automatic deduplication and categorization

#### Step 2: AI Analysis & Matching
```typescript
interface QuestionAnalysis {
  semantic_matching: {
    question: "Do you encrypt data at rest?",
    matched_evidence: [
      "AWS S3 encryption policy",
      "Database encryption certificate",
      "SOC2 Type II report - Section 3.2"
    ],
    suggested_answer: "Yes, we implement AES-256 encryption...",
    confidence: "95%",
    evidence_links: ["erip.io/evidence/encryption-policy-v2"]
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Answer Enhancement
- **Pre-filled Answers**: Based on your Trust Equity data
- **Evidence Attachment**: Automatic evidence bundling
- **Gap Identification**: Highlights what's missing
- **Expert Assistance**: One-click expert help for complex questions

#### Step 4: Review & Customize
```typescript
interface ReviewInterface {
  answer_customization: {
    tone_adjustment: "Formal | Conversational | Technical",
    length_control: "Concise | Detailed | Custom",
    customer_specific: "Add buyer-specific context",
    version_control: "Track changes across iterations"
  },
  
  collaboration: {
    team_review: "Tag teammates for specific sections",
    expert_review: "Request expert validation",
    approval_workflow: "Multi-stage approval process",
    audit_trail: "Complete change history"
  }
}
```

### 4. Advanced Features

#### A. Question Bank Intelligence
```typescript
interface QuestionBank {
  pattern_recognition: {
    common_questions: "10,000+ indexed security questions",
    best_answers: "Top-rated answers by industry/size",
    evolution_tracking: "How questions change over time",
    predicitive_prep: "Anticipate upcoming questions"
  },
  
  benchmarking: {
    industry_standards: "How others answer similar questions",
    win_rate_analysis: "Which answers close deals faster",
    red_flag_detection: "Answers that raise concerns",
    optimization_tips: "Improve answer effectiveness"
  }
}
```

#### B. Continuous Learning
```typescript
interface LearningSystem {
  feedback_loop: {
    buyer_reactions: "Track which answers satisfy buyers",
    follow_up_patterns: "Learn from additional questions",
    success_metrics: "Measure answer effectiveness",
    improvement_suggestions: "AI-powered optimization"
  },
  
  organizational_memory: {
    answer_evolution: "How your answers improve over time",
    team_knowledge: "Capture institutional knowledge",
    expert_insights: "Incorporate expert feedback",
    compliance_updates: "Auto-update for new requirements"
  }
}
```

### 5. Integration with Trust Score

#### Synergy Benefits:
1. **Auto-Population**: Trust Score data fills questionnaires
2. **Evidence Linking**: Direct links to verified evidence
3. **Real-time Updates**: Answers update as compliance changes
4. **Buyer Portal**: Share live questionnaire status

### 6. ROI & Metrics

#### Measurable Benefits:
```typescript
interface QIE_ROI {
  time_savings: {
    traditional: "40 hours per questionnaire",
    with_qie: "2 hours review time",
    savings: "95% reduction"
  },
  
  accuracy_improvement: {
    human_error_reduction: "99% fewer inconsistencies",
    evidence_attachment: "100% evidence coverage",
    update_propagation: "Instant across all questionnaires"
  },
