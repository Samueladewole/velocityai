# GDPR International Data Transfers: The EDPS Microsoft 365 Decision and Its Broader Implications

The European Data Protection Supervisor's landmark 2025 decision against the European Commission's use of Microsoft 365 represents a watershed moment in international data transfer enforcement, fundamentally reshaping how organizations approach cross-border data flows in the post-Schrems II era. **This enforcement action achieved compliance by July 2025 and established critical precedents** for cloud service contracts with major technology providers, while demonstrating that even EU institutions must meet the highest data protection standards when conducting international transfers.

## The EDPS Microsoft 365 decision: A precedent-setting enforcement action

The case that garnered significant attention was actually a **European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) decision rather than an EDPB ruling**, but its implications for international data transfers are profound. On **March 8, 2025**, the EDPS issued a formal decision finding the European Commission in violation of EU data protection law for its use of Microsoft 365 cloud services.

The investigation, which began in May 2021 following the Schrems II judgment, revealed **three critical violations** under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. First, **purpose limitation failures** where the Commission failed to sufficiently specify what personal data types were collected and for which explicit purposes, allowing Microsoft to process data for its own business purposes including relationship management and internal reporting. Second, **international data transfer violations** involving inadequate safeguards for data transferred outside the EU/EEA, with insufficient mapping of transfers and no proper transfer impact assessments despite data flowing to Microsoft servers in the US and other non-EU countries. Third, **unauthorized disclosure risks** due to failure to assess third-country legislation that might compel data disclosure and insufficient technical and organizational measures.

The EDPS imposed **immediate corrective measures with a December 9, 2025** compliance deadline, including suspension of all data flows from Microsoft 365 to non-EU/EEA countries without adequacy decisions. **Remarkably, compliance was achieved ahead of schedule**, with the EDPS confirming on July 11, 2025, that all violations were resolved and enforcement proceedings closed. The European Commission implemented comprehensive improvements including explicit specification of data types and processing purposes, limited transfers to countries with adequacy decisions, and enhanced contractual, technical, and organizational safeguards.

## Current international data transfer mechanisms under GDPR

The GDPR's Chapter V establishes a sophisticated three-tier framework for international transfers that has evolved significantly since the Schrems II decision. **Adequacy decisions** remain the gold standard, with the European Commission currently recognizing 15 jurisdictions including the United States under the **EU-US Data Privacy Framework adopted July 10, 2023**. This framework, which replaced the invalidated Privacy Shield, has attracted over 1,000 company certifications within its first six months and provides enhanced protections including proportionality requirements for US intelligence gathering and an independent redress mechanism through the Data Protection Review Court.

**Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** serve as the primary fallback mechanism, with modernized versions adopted in June 2021 featuring a **modular structure** covering four transfer scenarios from controller-to-controller through processor-to-controller arrangements. The post-Schrems II evolution requires **Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs)** examining third-country laws and practices, with data exporters obligated to implement supplementary measures where standard tools prove insufficient. These assessments must follow the **EDPB's six-step roadmap** and evaluate protection levels against European Essential Guarantees covering legal clarity, necessity and proportionality, independent oversight, and effective remedies.

**Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)** enable multinational groups to facilitate intra-group transfers through legally binding internal policies, though the approval process remains complex and requires EDPB consistency mechanism involvement. The framework has been updated post-Schrems II with enhanced requirements for government access assessment and integration with supplementary measures requirements.

## Why this ruling proved significant for international transfer enforcement

The EDPS Microsoft 365 decision crystallized several critical developments in data protection enforcement that extend far beyond a single case. **It represented the first major enforcement action targeting public sector use of a US technology giant's services**, establishing that EU institutions cannot claim exemption from rigorous data protection standards when selecting cloud providers. This precedent has profound implications given that public sector procurement often influences private sector technology adoption patterns.

The decision emerged within a broader **enforcement evolution following Schrems II**, where European supervisory authorities transformed from guidance-focused entities to coordinated enforcement authorities. The **€1.2 billion Meta penalty in May 2023** had already demonstrated willingness to impose business-affecting penalties, but the Microsoft case showed this scrutiny extended to government entities themselves. This represented a systematic shift from reactive to proactive enforcement, with supervisory authorities now conducting coordinated investigations across multiple jurisdictions.

The **technical standards elevation** proved equally significant. The decision established that encryption, access controls, and audit capabilities have become baseline requirements rather than optional enhancements. Microsoft's response through its "Defending Your Data" initiative, including contractual commitments not to provide governments with encryption keys and implementation of EU Data Boundary services, **set new industry standards** for how technology companies must respond to European data protection concerns.

## Current status and subsequent regulatory developments

The resolution of the EDPS case by July 2025 coincided with broader regulatory evolution that has fundamentally altered the international transfer landscape. **The EU-US Data Privacy Framework** has provided legal certainty for transatlantic transfers, with companies rapidly transitioning from Standard Contractual Clauses to this more streamlined mechanism. Meta's immediate adoption following framework approval exemplifies how major technology companies prioritize regulatory predictability.

**Standard Contractual Clauses continue evolving**, with the European Commission announcing new SCCs for Q2 2025 addressing transfers between entities both subject to GDPR under Article 3. This addresses identified gaps in current frameworks and demonstrates ongoing refinement of transfer mechanisms based on practical implementation experience.

The **EDPB's strategic evolution through 2025-2027** emphasizes cross-regulatory cooperation with the Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, and AI Act enforcement. This integration reflects recognition that data protection cannot be addressed in isolation from broader digital governance frameworks. The establishment of **Support Pool of Experts** initiatives provides specialized enforcement capacity for complex technical assessments.

**Enforcement statistics reveal intensifying scrutiny**: the EDPB adopted eight Article 64(2) consistency opinions in 2025, focusing on "consent or pay" models, facial recognition, and AI training data. Cross-border case volume continues growing, with emphasis shifting from individual authority actions to coordinated investigations across all 47 EU/EEA supervisory authorities.

## Practical implications for businesses conducting international transfers

Organizations face a **dramatically transformed compliance landscape** requiring sophisticated risk management approaches. **Transfer Impact Assessments** have become mandatory for any transfers to countries without adequacy decisions, necessitating case-by-case analysis of destination country surveillance laws, local data protection enforcement, and potential conflicts with EU standards. The **EDPB's six-step methodology** provides systematic guidance but requires substantial legal and technical expertise to implement effectively.

**Vendor due diligence obligations** have intensified significantly. Controllers must maintain comprehensive information about all processors and sub-processors, verify technical and organizational safeguards through external audits and certifications, and monitor ongoing compliance through regular assessments. The **five-step vendor due diligence framework** encompasses data handling practices assessment, policies and procedures review, technical security evaluation, international transfer controls verification, and risk mitigation contracting.

**Cloud service provider selection** now requires careful evaluation of data location controls, encryption options, access controls, compliance certifications, and transparency regarding government access requests. Major providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have developed comprehensive GDPR compliance frameworks, but organizations must still conduct individual assessments based on their specific data processing needs and risk tolerance.

**Compliance costs have escalated substantially**, with PwC research indicating 88% of global companies spend over €1 million annually on GDPR compliance, while 40% exceed €10 million annually. However, **positive return on investment** is achievable, with 40% of organizations reporting benefits through enhanced data quality, improved customer trust, and reduced breach costs.

## Implementation roadmap for organizational compliance

**Immediate actions** within 0-3 months should focus on comprehensive data mapping to identify all international transfers, vendor assessment to conduct due diligence on existing processors, and legal basis review to ensure appropriate transfer mechanisms. Organizations must document transfer mechanisms currently in use and assess adequacy decision coverage while updating Data Processing Agreements with enhanced provisions.

**Medium-term implementation** over 3-12 months requires policy and procedure development including international transfer policies and vendor assessment procedures, technical measures implementation encompassing encryption and access controls, and comprehensive training programs to establish data protection culture throughout the organization.

**Long-term compliance programs** extending beyond 12 months emphasize continuous monitoring through regular vendor assessments and transfer mechanism effectiveness reviews, process optimization through automated compliance monitoring, and strategic planning including data localization strategies and cloud architecture optimization.

The regulatory landscape continues evolving rapidly, requiring organizations to maintain flexible compliance strategies while ensuring robust protection of personal data in international transfers. **Success requires ongoing commitment**, appropriate resource allocation, and close collaboration between legal, technical, and business teams to navigate complex regulatory requirements while maintaining operational effectiveness.

## Conclusion

The EDPS Microsoft 365 decision represents more than a single enforcement action—it exemplifies the maturation of European data protection enforcement into a systematic, coordinated effort that holds all entities, including government institutions, to the highest standards. **The achievement of compliance by July 2025** demonstrates that pragmatic solutions exist for even complex international transfer scenarios, but only through comprehensive technical, organizational, and contractual safeguards.

Organizations must recognize that international data transfer compliance has evolved from a checkbox exercise into a **fundamental business capability** requiring sophisticated risk management, ongoing monitoring, and strategic planning. The convergence of enhanced enforcement, technical standards elevation, and expanded regulatory cooperation creates both challenges and opportunities for businesses willing to invest in robust compliance frameworks that protect data subjects while enabling legitimate international commerce.
