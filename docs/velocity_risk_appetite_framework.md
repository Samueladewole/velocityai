# ERIP Risk Appetite Framework Integration
## Automating the Pragmatic Risk Appetite Approach

---

## Framework Overview

The video presents a **pragmatic risk appetite framework** that ERIP can automate and scale across the entire platform. Instead of manual, static processes, ERIP transforms this into dynamic, AI-powered decision intelligence.

### **Manual Process (Current State) → ERIP Automation (Future State)**

---

## 1. Risk Appetite vs. Tolerance Definition

### **Manual Approach** (Video)
- **Risk Appetite**: Goal/target (like speed limit of 65 mph)
- **Risk Tolerance**: Behavior modification to stay near goal (driving 60-70 mph)
- Manual documentation and communication

### **ERIP Automation** (CLEARANCE + PRISM Integration)
```typescript
interface AutomatedRiskAppetite {
  appetite_definition: {
    loss_scenario: "AI-generated from ATLAS findings";
    magnitude_threshold: "PRISM Monte Carlo modeling";
    probability_threshold: "Statistical analysis with confidence intervals";
    business_context: "Claude Sonnet 4 analysis of risk vs opportunity";
  };
  
  tolerance_monitoring: {
    real_time_tracking: "PULSE continuous monitoring";
    behavioral_alerts: "Automated notifications when approaching thresholds";
    dynamic_adjustment: "AI-powered threshold optimization based on outcomes";
    stakeholder_routing: "CLEARANCE approval authority automation";
  };
