# ERIP €€€ Positioning Implementation Roadmap
## Achieving Financial-First Enterprise Risk Intelligence

### Executive Summary

This roadmap details how ERIP will transform from a security platform into **"The Security Platform That Pays for Itself"** through systematic implementation of financial-first positioning across all 8 core tools. Our goal: demonstrate measurable €€€ value that justifies enterprise budgets and accelerates sales cycles.

**Target Outcome**: Position ERIP as a profit-generating business tool, not a cost center.
