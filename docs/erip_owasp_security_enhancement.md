# ERIP OWASP Security Enhancement
## Comprehensive AI & Web Application Security Framework

---

## Overview

This security enhancement implements **OWASP Top 10 for Web Applications (2021)** and **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2023)** across the entire ERIP platform. Given ERIP's extensive use of AI across all 8 components and its web-based architecture, both frameworks are critical for enterprise-grade security.

### **Security Integration Strategy**
- **Proactive Security**: Security built into every component from design phase
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers across all attack vectors
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and threat detection
- **Compliance Ready**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, and regulatory compliance integration
