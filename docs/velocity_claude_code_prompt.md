## CRITICAL: Resource Efficiency Architecture

### **Language-Specific Implementation (MANDATORY)**

Given tight resource constraints, optimal language selection is critical:

```typescript
interface ResourceOptimizedArchitecture {
  python_backend: {
    components: ["PRISM computational engine", "ML model serving", "Statistical analysis", "Monte Carlo simulations"];
    reasons: ["10x faster mathematical operations", "Native ML library support", "Memory efficient for large datasets"];
    libraries: ["NumPy", "SciPy", "Pandas", "QuantLib", "vLLM", "FastAPI"];
    deployment: "AWS Lambda (Python runtime) + EC2 for model serving";
  };
  
  typescript_frontend: {
    components: ["React UI components", "API routing", "Business logic", "Authentication"];
    reasons: ["Type safety", "Developer productivity", "Web ecosystem", "Real-time updates"];
    libraries: ["Vite", "React", "shadcn/ui", "Zustand", "Prisma"];
    deployment: "AWS Amplify + API Gateway";
  };
  
  performance_critical: {
    monte_carlo_simulations: "Python (100x faster than TypeScript)";
    ai_model_inference: "Python with optimized libraries (vLLM, transformers)";
    large_dataset_processing: "Python with Pandas/NumPy";
    financial_calculations: "Python with QuantLib";
    real_time_apis: "TypeScript with Express.js/Fastify";
  };
}
```

### **Resource Efficiency Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

```bash
# Rule: Use Python for ALL computational tasks
claude-code "CRITICAL: Implement ALL mathematical operations, ML inference, statistical analysis, and data processing in Python. Do NOT use TypeScript for Monte Carlo simulations, risk calculations, or AI model serving. This is mandatory for resource efficiency."

# Rule: Use TypeScript ONLY for web interfaces and API coordination
claude-code "CRITICAL: Use TypeScript ONLY for React components, API routing, database ORM operations, and user interfaces. Do NOT implement computational logic in TypeScript as it will be 10-100x slower and consume excessive resources."

# Rule: Optimize for minimal resource consumption
claude-code "CRITICAL: Given tight resource constraints, optimize every component for minimal CPU/memory usage. Use appropriate data structures, efficient algorithms, and proper caching. Monitor resource usage continuously."
```

## CRITICAL: Document Reference Requirements

**Before starting any implementation, you MUST:**

1. **Read and analyze ALL documents in `/Velocity-app/doc/`** directory
2. **Extract all requirements, specifications, and rules** from each document
3. **Create a complete implementation plan** based on document specifications
4. **Follow ALL rules and guidelines** specified in the documents without compromise
5. **Reference specific document sections** when making implementation decisions
