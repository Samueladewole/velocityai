# ERIP Authentication & Authorization Architecture
## Enterprise-Grade Identity & Access Management System

---

## Overview

ERIP's authentication and authorization architecture provides **enterprise-grade security** with seamless user experience across all 8 platform components. The system supports complex organizational hierarchies, regulatory compliance requirements, and integration with existing enterprise identity systems while maintaining high performance and scalability.

---

## Core Architecture Principles

### **Security-First Design**
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required access only
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Continuous Verification**: Ongoing access validation

### **Enterprise Integration**
- **SSO Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing identity providers
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Complete organizational isolation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA compliance
- **Audit Trail**: Complete access and activity logging

### **Performance & Scalability**
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime for authentication services
- **Low Latency**: <100ms authentication response times
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support for 100,000+ concurrent users
- **Efficient Caching**: Optimized permission resolution
