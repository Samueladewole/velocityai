# ERIP User Roles & Permissions Matrix
## Comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Framework

## Overview

ERIP's user role system is designed to support complex enterprise organizational structures while maintaining strict security and compliance controls. The framework accommodates multiple organizational hierarchies, regulatory requirements, and specialized expertise areas across all 8 platform components.

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Role Assignment Process**
```typescript
interface RoleAssignmentProcess {
  initial_setup: {
    organization_assessment: "Identify organizational structure and requirements";
    role_mapping: "Map existing roles to ERIP role framework";
    permission_calibration: "Adjust permissions based on organizational needs";
    pilot_deployment: "Start with core team and expand gradually";
  };
  
  ongoing_management: {
    regular_reviews: "Quarterly role and permission reviews";
    access_recertification: "Annual access rights validation";
    role_updates: "Process for role modification requests";
    compliance_monitoring: "Continuous compliance with role policies";
  };
  
  automation: {
    automated_provisioning: "Role-based automatic account creation";
    lifecycle_management: "Automated role changes based on HR systems";
    compliance_checking: "Automated policy compliance validation";
    audit_reporting: "Automated role and access reporting";
  };
}
```

This comprehensive user roles framework ensures that ERIP can support complex enterprise organizations while maintaining strict security, compliance, and governance controls across all platform components.
