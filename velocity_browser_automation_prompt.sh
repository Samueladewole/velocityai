   - Navigate cloud consoles intelligently to find security settings
   - Extract data from tables, forms, and dashboard widgets
   - Handle dynamic content and loading states

C. Error Handling:
   - Graceful failure when automation encounters issues
   - Fallback to manual processes when automation fails
   - User notifications when manual intervention needed
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging automation issues

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Evidence Collection Engine:
   ```typescript
   interface EvidenceCollectionEngine {
     platforms: ['AWS', 'GCP', 'Azure', 'GitHub'],
     automation_types: ['screenshots', 'configuration_export', 'access_logs'],
     schedule: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'on_demand',
     security: 'encrypted_credentials' | 'audit_logging'
   }
   ```

2. Questionnaire Intelligence:
   ```typescript
   interface QuestionnaireIntelligence {
     parsing: 'extract_questions_from_any_format',
     matching: 'match_questions_to_evidence',
     generation: 'auto_generate_responses',
     review: 'human_review_and_approval_workflow'
   }
   ```

3. Monitoring System:
   ```typescript
   interface ComplianceMonitoring {
     detection: 'monitor_configuration_changes',
     alerting: 'real_time_compliance_alerts',
     updating: 'auto_update_trust_scores',
     reporting: 'generate_change_reports'
   }
   ```

CUSTOMER VALUE PROPOSITION:
- Reduce evidence collection time from hours to minutes
- Eliminate manual screenshot capture and data entry
- Keep compliance data always current and accurate
- Speed up vendor questionnaire responses from weeks to hours

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:
- First compliance platform with intelligent automation
- Reduce manual compliance work by 90%
- Always-current compliance data vs stale screenshots
- Faster vendor onboarding and sales cycles

BUILD PRIORITY:
Week 1-2: AWS evidence collection automation
Week 3-4: Questionnaire parsing and auto-filling
Week 5-6: Real-time monitoring and alerting
Week 7-8: Integration testing and refinement

CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS:
- 90% reduction in evidence collection time
- 95% accuracy in automated evidence capture
- 80% of questionnaire responses auto-generated
- Same-day questionnaire turnaround vs 2-week industry standard

This is IMMEDIATE value-add for launch customers, not future roadmap features.
Focus on practical automation that solves real customer pain points TODAY.
